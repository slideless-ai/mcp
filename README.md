# slideless-mcp

MCP server for Slideless. Wraps the Slideless HTTP API as Model Context Protocol tools so users can list, share, upload, and manage HTML presentations from any MCP host (Claude Desktop, claude.ai, ChatGPT desktop, Cursor, etc.) without installing the `slideless` CLI.

Hosted on **Vercel** (Next.js App Router + [`mcp-handler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-handler)) at **`https://mcp.slideless.ai/mcp`**. Listed on the official MCP registry as **`ai.slideless/mcp`**.

## Architecture

Stateless Next.js route handler — streamable-HTTP transport, no session store. A per-request `McpServer` is built on each `/mcp` call and the user's `Authorization` header is forwarded verbatim to the Slideless Cloud Functions in `europe-west1`. No database, no secrets to rotate — the user's token never leaves the request.

```

                 europe-west1-slideless-ai.cloudfunctions.net
```

## Authentication

The server is an OAuth 2.1 **resource server**. It does not host the auth flow itself — it advertises `app.slideless.ai` as the authorization server and forwards tokens to the Cloud Functions, which validate them. Two header styles are accepted, both forwarded verbatim:

- **OAuth (recommended)** — hosts that speak OAuth (Claude Desktop, claude.ai) discover the flow automatically: a no-auth request to `/mcp` returns `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728), which points at `app.slideless.ai`. The user signs in / signs up and consents in-browser; no key is ever pasted. New API keys are minted invisibly by the authorization server.
- **Static API key** — hosts that support custom headers (Cursor, Claude Code) can send `Authorization: Bearer cko_…` directly.

### Use as a connector

1. In Claude Desktop / claude.ai / ChatGPT: add a custom connector with URL `https://mcp.slideless.ai/mcp`.
2. The host discovers OAuth and opens the Slideless sign-in. Authorize, and you're connected.
3. (Static-key hosts only) Get a `cko_…` key at https://app.slideless.ai → Settings → API Keys, and set it as the `Authorization` header.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # next dev → http://localhost:8787
```

Test with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
# Transport: Streamable HTTP
# URL: http://localhost:8787/mcp
# Header: Authorization: Bearer cko_<your-key>
```

Or with raw curl (initialize handshake):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8787/mcp -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cko_<your-key>" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}'
```

Type checking: `pnpm typecheck`.

## Deploy

Pushed to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys production (project `codika/slideless-mcp`). Manual deploy:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --scope codika
```

**Rate limiting** is enforced at the edge by Vercel WAF rules (managed via the `vercel firewall` CLI), matching `path` starts-with `/mcp`:

- `mcp-per-ip` → 60 req / 10s, keyed by IP
- `mcp-per-key` → 600 req / 60s, keyed by the `Authorization` header (so each API key / OAuth token gets its own bucket)

Both return `429` when exceeded, before the function runs. Recreate with:

```bash
vercel firewall rules add "mcp-per-ip" --condition '{"type":"path","op":"pre","value":"/mcp"}' \
  --action rate_limit --rate-limit-window 10 --rate-limit-requests 60 --rate-limit-keys ip --yes
vercel firewall rules add "mcp-per-key" --condition '{"type":"path","op":"pre","value":"/mcp"}' \
  --action rate_limit --rate-limit-window 60 --rate-limit-requests 600 --rate-limit-keys header:authorization --yes
vercel firewall publish --yes
```
